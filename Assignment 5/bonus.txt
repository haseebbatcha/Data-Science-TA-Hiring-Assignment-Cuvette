1) How I’d support students struggling with concepts or deadlines:

As a final year student, I’ve seen how easily students can feel lost when concepts pile up or deadlines feel too close. 
If someone is struggling, I’d first assure them that it’s okay to feel that way — we’ve all been there. 
I’d sit with them to understand exactly where they’re stuck and break the concept down into smaller, digestible parts. 
For deadlines, I’d help them prioritize tasks and create a simple plan to stay on track. 
I also believe peer learning really helps — sometimes, hearing a concept from a friend can be more effective than a classroom explanation. 
I’d use diagrams, examples from everyday life, or even short quizzes to keep things engaging. I’d also share resources like cheat sheets or YouTube links that helped me. 
My goal would be to make them feel supported, confident, and never alone in their learning journey.


2) How I would break down a complex topic like “Gradient Descent” for beginners:

When teaching a topic like Gradient Descent, I’d avoid jumping straight into equations. 
Instead, I’d start with a relatable example — like finding the lowest point in a hilly landscape while blindfolded, using just your feet to sense the slope. 
That’s essentially what Gradient Descent does — it takes small steps in the direction that reduces the error. 
I’d then use simple visuals to show how the cost function decreases with each step. 
To make it more interactive, I’d explain how the learning rate controls the size of the steps — too big and you might overshoot, too small and you’ll take forever. 
I’d compare it to adjusting your speed when walking downhill. After building the intuition, I’d slowly introduce the math, explaining gradients and partial derivatives in the most basic way. 
Finally, I’d show a real-world implementation using Python or visualize the steps using an animation to reinforce the concept.
