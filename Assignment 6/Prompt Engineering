I am using my first assigment for the given task on ChatGPT
Here, for my first assignment (the Student Performance Dataset analysis using EDA, classification, etc.), 
here's how you can complete the Prompt Engineering section step-by-step:

Step 1:
Prompt which I gave:
"Perform Exploratory Data Analysis on the Student Performance Dataset (Math/Portuguese), and generate multiple code segments 
using seaborn and matplotlib to explain distributions, relationships between features, and pass/fail analysis. Include comments for students to understand each plot."


Step 2:
Response from the AI:
# Distribution of math scores
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.histplot(df['math score'], bins=20, kde=True, color='skyblue')
plt.title('Distribution of Math Scores')
plt.xlabel('Math Score')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()

# Boxplot to compare scores by gender
plt.figure(figsize=(8,5))
sns.boxplot(data=df, x='gender', y='math score', palette='pastel')
plt.title('Math Scores by Gender')
plt.show()



Step 3:
What did the AI do well?
      The AI did a great job by generating EDA code with clear visualizations and relevant labels. 
      It selected appropriate plots (histograms, boxplots, pairplots) that made the data easier to understand for beginners. 
      The inline comments were helpful for explaining to students. 

What did you have to modify or improve?
      I added additional plots like countplot for pass/fail counts and heatmap for correlation to give students a complete picture of the dataset.
      I customized plot titles, axis labels, and color palettes to make the visualizations more readable and engaging.
      For the classification part, I modified the target variable by creating a new binary column (pass/fail) based on average score, since the dataset didnâ€™t have a direct "pass" column.
      I also explained the logic behind splitting the data, standardizing features, and evaluating the model, to ensure students understand every step.
